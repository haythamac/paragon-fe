December 9, 2025

installed packages:
tailwind
shadcn vue
vue-router@4


added import path from 'path' to vite.config.js
resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
    },
  },

we do this so we can use the @ when referencing paths like so
'@/views/Raffle.vue'

- created a guild raffle page with filter panel, admin panel, and card list for all the raffles
